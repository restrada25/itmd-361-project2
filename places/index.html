        <h2>Indiana Dunes</h2>
        <p>
          Indiana Dunes is a beautiful place. It has a park within the forest and places to have cookouts. Some of the trails can be really hard since the sand makes it harder to walk.
          However, getting to the beach after finishing the trail makes it worth it.

                  The views at the top of the dunes are amazing. You get to see how big the surrounding forest is and how close you are to the beach.
