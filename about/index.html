    <section id="background">
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Ruben Estrada. I am a Computer Science major and in my last semester at IIT.
        I feel bittersweet about graduating. I am looking forward to getting my degree but I am 
        not looking forward to working 40 hours each week for the rest of my life. I am a member 
        of the Omega Delta National Fraternity. Although I am currently the Treasurer, I have been 
        the Vice President, and Risk Management positions in previous semesters. During high 
        school, I was part of the chess club, robotics team, and tennis team. I was able to 
        participate in the state chess tournament. I also went to the First robotics competition 
        with the robotics team. It was a lot of fun. Both of these activities required strategy 
        and problem solving. Often an unexpected piece of the robot would break in between rounds 
        and it would require quick thinking to fix.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>
            Video games have always been a part of my life. My first video game system was the 
            Super Nintendo. I remember knowing every secret in Super Mario Bros and just breezing 
            through the levels. Even today, I spend a lot of my free time playing video games with 
            my friends. The game I currently play the most is League of Legends. I've been playing 
            this game frequently for the past 3 years. I have also recently started playing 
            Overwatch. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Watching Cartoons and Anime</h3>
          <p>
            Next to video games, watching anime takes up a big chunk of my free time. There exists 
            a lot of good animes. I was thinking of making a website for my top 10 anime but it 
            would be hard to decide. One of my favorite animes is called Gurren Lagann. It is epic 
            and inspirational. Besides anime, I like to watch cartoons and studio Ghibli movies. I 
            cosplayed Ashitaka from the movie Princess Mononoke this past Anime Midwest convention.
            Although Adventure time is often seen as a kids cartoon, it is really emotional and 
            deep. This makes it one of my favorite cartoons at the moment. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Drawing</h3>
          <p>
            Drawing was one of my biggest hobbies during high school. I would draw random 
            characters for the fun of it and sometimes requested characters. However, I am still 
            not good at coming up with my own figures. I usually look up pictures and use that as 
            a base. However, I have not practiced this the past few years but I want to get back 
            into it. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Chess</h3>
          <p>
            Although I have not played chess as much after finishing high school. I still like to 
            play it occasionally with friends. I like that chess is challenging and every game is 
            different. It is also a completely different experience playing against different 
            opponents.
